Test Planning in STLC
Test Planning in STLC is a phase in which a Senior QA manager determines the test plan strategy along with efforts and cost estimates for the project. Moreover, the resources, test environment, test limitations and the testing schedule are also determined. The Test Plan gets prepared and finalized in the same phase.

Test Planning Activities

Preparation of test plan/strategy document for various types of testing
Test tool selection
Test effort estimation
Resource planning and determining roles and responsibilities.
Training requirement
Deliverables of Test Planning

Test plan /strategy document.
Effort estimation document.
Test Case Development Phase
The Test Case Development Phase involves the creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts after the test plan is ready. Initially, the Test data is identified then created and reviewed and then reworked based on the preconditions. Then the QA team starts the development process of test cases for individual units.

Test Case Development Activities

Create test cases, automation scripts (if applicable)
Review and baseline test cases and scripts
Create test data (If Test Environment is available)

Test Environment Setup
Test Environment Setup decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is tested. It is one of the critical aspects of the testing process and can be done in parallel with the Test Case Development Phase. Test team may not be involved in this activity if the development team provides the test environment. The test team is required to do a readiness check (smoke testing) of the given environment.

Test Environment Setup Activities

Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
Setup test Environment and test data
Perform smoke test on the build
Deliverables of Test Environment Setup

Environment ready with test data set up
Smoke Test Results.
Test Execution Phase
Test Execution Phase is carried out by the testers in which testing of the software build is done based on test plans and test cases prepared. The process consists of test script execution, test script maintenance and bug reporting. If bugs are reported then it is reverted back to development team for correction and retesting will be performed.

Test Execution Activities

Execute tests as per plan
Document test results, and log defects for failed cases
Map defects to test cases in RTM
Retest the Defect fixes
Track the defects to closure
Deliverables of Test Execution

Completed RTM with the execution status
Test cases updated with results
Defect reports

Test Cycle Closure
Test Cycle Closure phase is completion of test execution which involves several activities like test completion reporting, collection of test completion matrices and test results. Testing team members meet, discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be implemented in future, taking lessons from current test cycle. The idea is to remove process bottlenecks for future test cycles.

Test Cycle Closure Activities

Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test coverage, Cost,Software, Critical Business Objectives, Quality
Prepare test metrics based on the above parameters.
Document the learning out of the project
Prepare Test closure report
Qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer.
Test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity.
