# Software Testing Projects FTS
### WHAT IS TESTING:
- Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
- Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

### WHY TESTING IS IMPORTANT:
- Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous. 
- Software bugs can potentially cause monetary and human loss, and history is full of such examples.
- The testing is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client. 
- which guarantees the quality of the software. 
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use. 
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software.
- It assures the quality of the product and satisfies the customers as well as users.  
- it promises better business optimization (less maintenance cost), reliability, and superior user experience.
