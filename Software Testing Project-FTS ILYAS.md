### WHAT IS TESTING:
- Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
- Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

### WHY TESTING IS IMPORTANT:
- Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous. 
- Software bugs can potentially cause monetary and human loss, and history is full of such examples.
- The testing is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client. 
- which guarantees the quality of the software. 
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use. 
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software.
- It assures the quality of the product and satisfies the customers as well as users.  
- it promises better business optimization (less maintenance cost), reliability, and superior user experience.

# What is a Software Testing Type? 
Software Testing Type is a classification of different testing activities into categories, each having, a defined test objective, test strategy, and test deliverables. The goal of having a testing type is to validate the Application Under Test (AUT) for the defined Test Objective.

### Types of Software key Testing:
- Testing is Classified in to Three Categorys.
 
- Functional Testing
- Non-Functional Testing or Performance Testing
- Maintenance (Regression and Maintenance)

### Unit Test:
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.

A unit is a single testable part of a software system and tested during the development phase of the application software. The purpose of unit testing is to test the correctness of isolated code

#	Integration Test:
- Integration testing -- also known as integration and testing (I &T) -- is a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. However, these modules may be coded by different programmer
- Integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after unit testing and before system testing.
- The purpose of the integration testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Once all the modules have been unit tested, integration testing is performed.

### Some different types of integration testing are 
	Big-bang, mixed (sandwich), 
	Risky-hardest, 
	Top-down, 
	Bottom-up.

What is meant by system testing?
System testing, also referred to as system-level tests or system-integration testing, is the process in which a quality assurance (QA) team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.

# What is system testing?
System Testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, the software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based system.

### What is the purpose of system test?
The purpose of system testing is to ensure that a system meets its specification and any non-functional requirements (such as stability and throughput) that have been agreed with its users.
### What is testing types of system testing?
System Testing is the level of software testing performed before Acceptance Testing and after Integration Testing. It comes under Black Box testing, i.e., only external working features of the software evaluated during this testing.
### Importance of System Test:
System Test is renowned as end-to-end testing, as it verifies the entire software. It provides a comprehensive report on the performance and compliance of the system with the business specified requirement. Also, at this level, the whole system is validated with unit-level performance.

### What are types of system testing?

#### Types of System Testing
- Regression Testing. 
- Load Testing. 
- Functional Testing. 
- Recovery Testing. 
- Migration Testing. 
- Usability Testing. 
- Software and Hardware Testing.

# What is Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?
- Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to ensure software quality goals are met. STLC involves both verification and validation activities. Contrary to popular belief, Software Testing is not just a single/isolate activity, i.e. testing. It consists of a series of activities carried out methodologically to help certify your software product. STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

# STLC Phases
### There are following six major phases in every Software Testing Life Cycle Model (STLC Model):

- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test case development
- Test Environment setup
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle closure

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105497741/173185460-84dc72b0-c3f7-4c5e-b799-40b67da9f0d8.png)
https://youtu.be/Dq5IYYqnnGQ?list=UU19i1XD6k88KqHlET8atqFQ

# Requirement Phase Testing:
Requirement Phase Testing also known as Requirement Analysis in which test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify testable requirements and the QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand requirements in detail. Requirements could be either functional or non-functional. Automation feasibility for the testing project is also done in this stage.

### Activities in Requirement Phase Testing

- Identify types of tests to be performed.
- Gather details about testing priorities and focus.
- Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).
- Identify test environment details where testing is supposed to be carried out.
- Automation feasibility analysis (if required).

# Test Planning in STLC

Test Planning in STLC is a phase in which a Senior QA manager determines the test plan strategy along with efforts and cost estimates for the project. Moreover, the resources, test environment, test limitations and the testing schedule are also determined. The Test Plan gets prepared and finalized in the same phase.

### Test Planning Activities

- Preparation of test plan/strategy document for various types of testing
- Test tool selection
- Test effort estimation
- Resource planning and determining roles and responsibilities.
- Training requirement

# Test Case Development Phase

The Test Case Development Phase involves the creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts after the test plan is ready. Initially, the Test data is identified then created and reviewed and then reworked based on the preconditions. Then the QA team starts the development process of test cases for individual units.

### Test Case Development Activities

- Create test cases, automation scripts (if applicable)
- Review and baseline test cases and scripts
- Create test data (If Test Environment is available)

# Test Environment Setup:

Test Environment Setup decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is tested. It is one of the critical aspects of the testing process and can be done in parallel with the Test Case Development Phase. Test team may not be involved in this activity if the development team provides the test environment. The test team is required to do a readiness check (smoke testing) of the given environment.

### Test Environment Setup Activities

- Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
- Setup test Environment and test data
- Perform smoke test on the build.

# Test Execution Phase:
Test Execution Phase is carried out by the testers in which testing of the software build is done based on test plans and test cases prepared. The process consists of test script execution, test script maintenance and bug reporting. If bugs are reported then it is reverted back to development team for correction and retesting will be performed.

### Test Execution Activities

- Execute tests as per plan
- Document test results, and log defects for failed cases
- Map defects to test cases in RTM
- Retest the Defect fixes
- Track the defects to closure

# Test Cycle Closure

Test Cycle Closure phase is completion of test execution which involves several activities like test completion reporting, collection of test completion matrices and test results. Testing team members meet, discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be implemented in future, taking lessons from current test cycle. The idea is to remove process bottlenecks for future test cycles.

### Test Cycle Closure Activities

- Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test coverage, Cost,Software, Critical Business Objectives, Quality
- Prepare test metrics based on the above parameters.
- Document the learning out of the project
- Prepare Test closure report
- Qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer.
- Test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity.

# STLC - Defect Life Cycle:
Defect Life Cycle, also known as Bug Life Cycle, is the journey of a defect, the cycle which a defect goes through during its lifetime. It varies from organization to organization and also from project to project, as it is governed by the software testing process and also depends upon the tools used.

### Defect Life Cycle – Workflow
The following diagram shows the workflow of a Defect Life Cycle.

### States of a Defect Life Cycle

***Following are the different states of a Defect Life Cycle***.

- New − Potential defect that is raised and yet to be validated.

- Assigned − Assigned against a development team to be addressed.

- Active − The Defect is being addressed by the developer and investigation is under progress. At this stage, there are two possible outcomes – Deferred or Rejected.

- Test / Fixed / Ready for Retest − The Defect is fixed and ready for testing.

- Verified − The Defect that is retested and the test has been verified by QA.

- Closed − The final state of the defect that can be closed after the QA retesting or can be closed if the defect is duplicate or considered as NOT a defect.

- Reopened − When the defect is NOT fixed, QA reopens/reactivates the defect.

- Deferred − When a defect cannot be addressed in that particular cycle it is deferred to future release.

- Rejected − A defect can be rejected for any of the three reasons – duplicate defect, NOT a Defect, Non Reproducible.

# What is a Test Case?
A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, postcondition developed for specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.
