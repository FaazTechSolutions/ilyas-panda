### WHAT IS TESTING:
- Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
- Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

### WHY TESTING IS IMPORTANT:
- Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous. 
- Software bugs can potentially cause monetary and human loss, and history is full of such examples.
- The testing is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client. 
- which guarantees the quality of the software. 
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use. 
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software.
- It assures the quality of the product and satisfies the customers as well as users.  
- it promises better business optimization (less maintenance cost), reliability, and superior user experience.

### WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF SOFTWARE TESTING:

# What is a Software Testing Type? 
Software Testing Type is a classification of different testing activities into categories, each having, a defined test objective, test strategy, and test deliverables. The goal of having a testing type is to validate the Application Under Test (AUT) for the defined Test Objective.

### Types of Software key Testing:
- Testing is Classified in to Three Categorys.
 
- Functional Testing
- Non-Functional Testing or Performance Testing
- Maintenance (Regression and Maintenance)

### Unit Test:
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.

A unit is a single testable part of a software system and tested during the development phase of the application software. The purpose of unit testing is to test the correctness of isolated code
#### Advantages of Unit Testing:
